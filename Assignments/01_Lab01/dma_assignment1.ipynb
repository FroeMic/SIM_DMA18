    "\n",
    "Data transformations are useful for preparing a dataset for answering a particular question. Part of this process involves generating features from the dataset you find relevant to the question at hand. For this lab, we will be using a Yelp reviews dataset. Each row in the dataset depicts one review along with the features of the review (the reviewer, the review text, etc.). The goal of this lab is to convert this reviews dataset into a reviewers dataset by creating different features of each reviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission for this assignment should be done *individually*, although you are allowed to work in groups of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission should be a zip file that includes (1) your code and (2) your single custom feature in csv format (with a column header equal to the description of the feature). Your code can be provided in one of two ways (a) a python file named qN.py which produces avg statistics for each question in the lab, where you replace N with the lab question number or (b) a single ipython notebook that clearly identifies the rows (with comments) of the notebook used to generate statistics for the respective question in the lab.\n"
